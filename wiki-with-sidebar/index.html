                <p>
                    Oasis are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. The group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher 
                    (lead vocals), Paul "BoneheadArthurs (guitar), Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums), with Liam asking his 
                    older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar, vocals) to join as a fifth member a few months later to finalise their formation. Noel became 
                    the de facto leader of the group and took over the songwriting duties for the band's first four albums. They are regarded 
                    as one of the defining and most globally successful groups of the Britpop genre.

                    Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released 
                    their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994), which topped the UK 
                    Albums Chart and quickly became the fastest-selling debut album in British history 
                    at the time. The following year, they released (What's the Story) Morning Glory? 
                    (1995) with new drummer Alan White in the midst of a highly publicised chart rivalry
                    with peers Blur, dubbed by the British media as the "Battle of Britpop". 
                    Spending ten weeks at number one on the British charts, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? 
                    was also an international chart success and became one of the best-selling albums of all 
                    time, the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the best-selling album in the UK of the 1990s.
                    The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers throughout the 1990s 
                    for their public disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth 
                    for an audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. 
                    In 1997, Oasis released their highly anticipated third studio album, Be Here Now, which became 
                    the fastest-selling album in UK chart history but retrospectively was seen as a critical 
                    disappointment.

                    Founding members Arthurs and McGuigan left in 1999 during the recording of the band's fourth studio 
                    album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). They were replaced by former Heavy Stereo 
                    guitarist Gem Archer on guitar and former Ride guitarist Andy Bell on bass guitar. 
                    White departed in 2004, replaced by guest drummer Zak Starkey, and later by Chris Sharrock. 
                    Oasis released three more studio albums in the 2000s: Heathen Chemistry (2002), Don't Believe
                    the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008). The group abruptly disbanded in 2009 after the
                    sudden departure of Noel Gallagher. The remaining members of the band continued under the name 
                    Beady Eye until their disbandment in 2014. Both Gallagher brothers have since had successful solo 
                    careers. In 2024, Oasis announced that they would reform in 2025 for worldwide performances as p
                    art of the Oasis Live '25 Tour.
