                <h1>Oasis (band)</h1>
                <p>
                    Oasis are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. The group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher 
                    (lead vocals), Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs (guitar), Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums), with Liam asking his 
                    older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar, vocals) to join as a fifth member a few months later to finalise their formation. Noel became 
                    the de facto leader of the group and took over the songwriting duties for the band's first four albums. They are regarded 
                    as one of the defining and most globally successful groups of the Britpop genre.
                </p>

                    Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released 
                    their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994), which topped the UK 
                    Albums Chart and quickly became the fastest-selling debut album in British history 
                    at the time. The following year, they released (What's the Story) Morning Glory? 
                    (1995) with new drummer Alan White in the midst of a highly publicised chart rivalry
                    with peers Blur, dubbed by the British media as the "Battle of Britpop". 
                    Spending ten weeks at number one on the British charts, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? 
                    was also an international chart success and became one of the best-selling albums of all 
                    time, the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the best-selling album in the UK of the 1990s.
                    The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers throughout the 1990s 
                    for their public disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth 
                    for an audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. 
                    In 1997, Oasis released their highly anticipated third studio album, Be Here Now, which became 
                    the fastest-selling album in UK chart history but retrospectively was seen as a critical 
                    disappointment.

                <p>
                    Founding members Arthurs and McGuigan left in 1999 during the recording of the band's fourth studio 
                    album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). They were replaced by former Heavy Stereo 
                    guitarist Gem Archer on guitar and former Ride guitarist Andy Bell on bass guitar. 
                    White departed in 2004, replaced by guest drummer Zak Starkey, and later by Chris Sharrock. 
                    Oasis released three more studio albums in the 2000s: Heathen Chemistry (2002), Don't Believe
                    the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008). The group abruptly disbanded in 2009 after the
                    sudden departure of Noel Gallagher. The remaining members of the band continued under the name 
                    Beady Eye until their disbandment in 2014. Both Gallagher brothers have since had successful solo 
                    careers. In 2024, Oasis announced that they would reform in 2025 for worldwide performances as 
                    part of the Oasis Live '25 Tour.

                <h4>1991–1993: Formation and early years</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1991, bassist Paul McGuigan, guitarist Paul Arthurs, drummer Tony McCarroll, and singer 
                    Chris Hutton formed a band called the Rain. Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and 
                    auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a potential replacement. Liam suggested that the 
                    band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster in the childhood 
                    bedroom he shared with his brother Noel, which listed the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon as a venue. 
                    Oasis played their first gig on 14 August 1991 at the Boardwalk club in Manchester, bottom of the 
                    bill below the Catchmen and Sweet Jesus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noel, who was working as a roadie for Inspiral Carpets, 
                    went with them to watch Liam's band play, and he was impressed with what he heard. Noel approached 
                    the group about joining on the provision that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, 
                    and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. Arthurs recalled, "He had 
                    loads of stuff written. When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a 
                    sudden, there were loads of ideas." Under Noel, the band crafted a musical approach that relied 
                    on simplicity, with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing barre chords and root bass notes, 
                    McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion. 
                    Oasis thus created a sound described as being "so devoid of finesse and complexity that it 
                    came out sounding pretty much unstoppable".
                </p>
                <h4>1993–1995: Breakthrough with <i>Definitely Maybe</i></h4>
                <p>
                    After over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a demo, the Live Demonstration tape, 
                    in May 1993, Oasis were spotted by the Creation Records co-owner Alan McGee. Oasis were invited to play 
                    a gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut club in Glasgow by Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis,
                    along with a group of friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were 
                    refused entry as they were not on that night's set list. They and McGee have given contradicting statements
                     about how they entered the club. They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there 
                     to see 18 Wheeler, and Sister Lovers, whose member Debbie Turner was a close friend of McGee's from his 
                     days frequenting the Haçienda in Manchester. McGee offered them a recording contract; however, they
                did not sign until several months later. Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis 
                signed a worldwide contract with Sony, which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following a limited white label release of the demo of their song "Columbia", Oasis went on a UK 
                    tour to promote the release of their first single, "Supersonic", playing venues such as the 
                    Tunbridge Wells Forum, a converted public toilet. "Supersonic" was released in April 1994, 
                    reaching number 31 in the charts. The release was followed by "Shakermaker", which became
                    the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages.
                    Their third single, "Live Forever", was their first to enter the top ten of the 
                    UK Singles Chart. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, Oasis's debut album, 
                    Definitely Maybe, was released on 29 August 1994. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one within
                    a week of its release, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nearly a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a hedonistic lifestyle, damaged the band. 
                    This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994, leading to an inept performance by Liam 
                    during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and hit Noel with a tambourine. Upset, Noel 
                    temporarily quit the band and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident the song "Talk Tonight" was written).
                    He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, he was persuaded to 
                    continue with the band. He reconciled with Liam and the tour resumed in Minneapolis. The group followed 
                    up with the fourth single from Definitely Maybe, "Cigarettes & Alcohol", and the Christmas single "Whatever", 
                    issued in December 1994, which entered the British charts at number three.

                <h4>1995–1996: <i>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</i>, international success, and peak popularity</h4> 
              <p>
                In April 1995, "Some Might Say" became their first number-one UK single. At the same time, McCarroll was ousted from the band.
                He said he was "unlawfully expelled from the partnership" for what he called a "personality clash" with the brothers.
                The Gallaghers were critical of McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: "I like Tony as a geezer but 
                he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs." He was replaced by Alan White, formerly of Starclub and the brother of the
                percussionist Steve White, who was recommended to Noel by Paul Weller. White made his debut with Oasis on a Top of the Pops 
                performance of "Some Might Say".

              <p>
                Oasis began recording material for their second album that May in Rockfield Studios near Monmouth. During this period, 
                the British press seized upon a supposed rivalry between Oasis and another Britpop band, Blur. Previously, Oasis had not 
                associated with the Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the BBC's Britpop Now programme introduced by Blur's 
                singer, Damon Albarn. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, setting up the "Battle of Britpop" 
                that dominated the national news. Blur's "Country House" outsold Oasis's "Roll with It" 274,000 copies to 216,000 during 
                the week. Oasis's management argued that "Country House" had sold more because it was less expensive (£1.99 vs £3.99) 
                and because there were two versions of the "Country House" single, with different B-sides, forcing fans to buy two copies.
                Creation said there were problems with the barcode on the "Roll with It" single case, which did not record all sales.
                Noel Gallagher told The Observer in September that he hoped members of Blur would "catch AIDS and die", which caused a 
                media furore. He apologised in a formal letter to various publications.
              </p>
                <p>
                McGuigan briefly left Oasis in September 1995, citing nervous exhaustion. He was replaced by Scott McLeod, formerly of the Ya Ya's, 
                who was featured on some of the tour dates as well as in the "Wonderwall" video before leaving abruptly while on tour in the US. 
                McLeod contacted Noel, saying he felt he had made the wrong decision. Noel replied: "I think you have, too. Good luck signing on."
                </p>
                <p>
                Although a softer sound initially led to mixed reviews, Oasis's second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, was a worldwide 
                commercial success, selling over four million copies and becoming the fifth-best-selling album in UK chart history. By 2008, 
                it had sold up to 22 million copies globally, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album produced two 
                more singles, "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger", which reached numbers two and one. It also contained "Champagne 
                Supernova", which featured guitar and backing vocals by Paul Weller and received critical acclaim. The song reached number 
                one on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. In November 1995, Oasis played on back-to-back nights at Earls Court in London, 
                the biggest ever indoor gigs in Europe at the time. Noel played a customised Sheraton guitar emblazoned with a Union Jack, 
                commercially released by Epiphone as the "Supernova".

                <p>
                On 27 and 28 April 1996, Oasis played their first headline outdoor concerts, at Maine Road football stadium, home of 
                Manchester City F.C., of whom the Gallagher brothers had been fans since childhood. Highlights from the second night 
                featured on the video ...There and Then, released later the same year (along with footage from their Earls Court gigs).
                As their career reached its zenith, Oasis performed to 80,000 people over two nights at Balloch Country Park at Loch Lomond
                in Scotland on 3 and 4 August, before back-to-back concerts at Knebworth House on 10 and 11 August. The band sold out both 
                shows within minutes. The audience of 125,000 people each night (2.5 million people applied for tickets, and 250,000 were 
                actually sold, meaning the possibility of 20 sold out nights) was a record-breaking number for an outdoor concert held in 
                the UK and remains the largest demand for a show in British history.

                    Oasis were due to record an episode of MTV Unplugged at the Royal Festival Hall but Liam pulled out, citing a sore throat.
                    He watched the performance from a balcony with beer and cigarettes, heckling Noel's singing between songs. Four days later
                    the group left for a tour of American arenas but Liam refused to go; the band decided to continue the tour with Noel on vocals. 
                    Liam rejoined the tour on 30 August and on 4 September 1996, Oasis performed "Champagne Supernova" at the 1996 MTV Video Music 
                    Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Liam made gestures at Noel during his guitar solo, then spat beer all over 
                    the stage before storming off. A few weeks later Noel flew home without the band, who followed on another flight. This event 
                    prompted media speculation that the group were splitting up. The brothers soon reconciled and decided to complete the tour.

                <p>
                    Musically, Oasis have been regarded as a rock band. More specifically, the band has been described as Britpop, indie rock, 
                    alternative rock, pop rock, neo-psychedelia,  psychedelic rock, and power pop. Oasis were most heavily influenced by the Beatles, 
                    an influence that was frequently labelled as an "obsession" by British media. The band were also strongly influenced by the other 
                    1960s British Invasion acts, including the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, and the Who. Another major influence, especially during the
                    band's early career, was 1970s British punk rock, in particular the Sex Pistols and their album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's 
                    the Sex Pistols (1977),  as well as the Damned, and the Jam/Paul Weller.  In addition, members of Oasis have cited as an influence
                    or inspiration AC/DC, Acetone, Burt Bacharach, Beck, the Bee Gees, David Bowie, the Doors, Peter Green–era Fleetwood Mac, Grant 
                    Lee Buffalo, the La's, MC5, Nirvana, Pink Floyd, Slade, the Smiths, the Soundtrack of Our Lives,  the Specials, the Stone Roses, 
                    the Stooges, T. Rex, the Verve, the Velvet Underground/Lou Reed, and Neil Young.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oasis albums consistently featured loud tracks characterized by nasal vocals. These dynamic Britpop compositions stood in 
                    stark contrast to the more polished pop tunes of Blur, their chart rivals.[177] Especially in their early years, Oasis's 
                    musical style and lyrics were grounded in the working-class backgrounds of Liam and Noel. The brothers became known for 
                    their rebellious demeanor, self-assured personalities, and sibling rivalry; these characteristics garnered media interest 
                    from the band's beginnings and endured throughout their entire career.

                <p>
                    Legal action has been taken against Noel Gallagher and Oasis for plagiarism on three occasions. The first was the case
                    of Neil Innes (formerly of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and the Rutles) suing to prove the Oasis song "Whatever" borrowed
                    from his song "How Sweet to Be an Idiot". Innes was eventually awarded royalties and a co-writer credit. Noel Gallagher 
                    said in 2010 that the plagiarism was unintentional and he was unaware of the similarities until informed of Innes's legal 
                    case. In the second incident, Oasis were sued by Coca-Cola and forced to pay $500,000 in damages to the New Seekers after 
                    it was alleged that the Oasis song "Shakermaker" had lifted words and melody from "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing". 
                    When asked about the incident, Noel Gallagher joked "Now we all drink Pepsi." On the third and final occasion, when 
                    promotional copies of (What's the Story) Morning Glory? were originally distributed, they contained a previously 
                    unreleased bonus song called "Step Out". This promotional CD was quickly withdrawn and replaced with a version that omitted 
                    the controversial song, which was allegedly similar to the Stevie Wonder song "Uptight (Everything's Alright)".
                    Official releases of "Step Out", as the B-side to "Don't Look Back in Anger" and on Familiar to Millions, 
                    listed "Wonder, et al." as co-writers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2003 song "Life Got Cold" by UK band Girls Aloud received attention due to similarities between the guitar riff and melody
                    of the song and that of the Oasis song "Wonderwall". A BBC review stated "part of the chorus sounds like it is going to turn into
                    'Wonderwall' by Oasis." Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Noel Gallagher as co-songwriter.

                    Despite originally parting ways in 2009, Oasis remain influential in British music and culture and are recognised as one of the
                    biggest and most acclaimed bands of the 1990s. They are recognised as one of the spearheads of Britpop, which has claimed a 
                    prominent place in British music. With their record breaking sales, concerts, sibling disputes, and their high-profile chart 
                    battle with Britpop rivals Blur, Oasis were a major part of 1990s UK pop culture, an era dubbed Cool Britannia. Many bands and
                    artists have cited Oasis as an influence or inspiration, including Arctic Monkeys, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Deafheaven, the 
                    Killers, Alvvays, Maroon 5, Coldplay, and Ryan Adams.

                    The band's success also helped local businesses. Pete Caban, owner of Bandwagon Music Supplies in Perth, Scotland, which closed
                    in 2020 after 37 years in business, said: "The highlight years were the mid-90s to the early 2000s. That was the peak period.
                    The Oasis period, as I call it, where everyone wanted to buy a guitar. That was the game changer for music and for me here in Perth. 
                    I was shovelling guitars out the door at the point. So hurrah for Noel Gallagher."

                    In 2007, Oasis were one of the four featured artists in the seventh episode of the BBC/VH1 series Seven Ages of Rock – an episode 
                    about British indie rock – along with Britpop peers Blur in addition to the Smiths and the Stone Roses.

                    In 2023, an unofficial music project by the name of AISIS was the first full-length album to use AI vocals. The project attracted 
                    more than half a million views within six weeks of publication, including newspaper articles written about it, and brought Breezer, 
                    the band that created the project, out of obscurity and landed them live dates. Bobby Geraghty and his Breezer bandmates wrote 
                    original Oasis-style songs and then used AI to create audio deepfakes based on Liam Gallagher's voice alongside their original 
                    instrumentation. Liam himself approved of the album, saying that he "sounded mega".

                    Oasis received a nomination for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on their sixth year of eligibility in February 2024. 
                    Initially, the members included in the nomination were the Gallagher brothers, McGuigan, White, Arthurs, McCarroll, Archer, 
                    and Bell. Liam Gallagher feels that the organisation is not authentic when it comes to rock music.
